# copy_jdk_configs
This project was created to support "parrallel installations" of java packages on Red Hat systems (multiple versions of the same package installed at the same time). Files of such package, including configuration files, are then placed in versioned directories. To preserve configurtion files in such scenario, during updates, custom [scriplets](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Scriptlets/) are required, as rpm does not support this out of box. This project contains shared code (scripts) called by these scriplets. They are being distributed in separate [package](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/copy-jdk-configs).
